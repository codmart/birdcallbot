# explanation in psuedo-code
# birdcall bot is a python app running off of Heroku

1. xl.py reads through a spreadsheet (ML_Birds_June_2017.xls) of the top 1000 results from Macaulay Library database search 
   for 'Audio' of 'Species: Birds' and then stores it in a series of corresponding lists, which can be called by creating a new Bird object.
2. dl.py runs main(), which creates a new Bird object from a given index number (defined by bot) and finds out, 
   based on the spreadsheet id #, where the audio of its call may be stored, and downloads it.
3. we use the Bird's common name (acquired from the spreadsheet) and the lxml package to sift through the Macaulay Libraries' HTML until
   we find a suitable image for it, which is downloaded in high quality.
4. using the names and credits from the spreadsheet as well as the photo credits from the image found via lxml, we construct a text file
   which stages the tweet for the bot to read later saved under 'tweet.mp4'
5. ffmpeg then truncates the audio to :30, fades it out, and combines it with the photo to make a nice tweetable .mp4 saved under 'video.mp4'
6. newbot.py runs these processes using a given number from 'line.txt', a text file with a single number which, using boto,
   is accessed from an Amazon S3 bucket. after acessing it adds 1 to the number shown in the text file so that it may progress through the list.
7. newbot.py uses the the tweepy python twitter api and authorizes connection with API keys defined in the os enviroment (which is also where boto keys are kept)
8. using fitnr's fork of the tweepy package (branch: video_upload2), newbot.py chunk uploads 'video.mp4' along with the status defined in 'tweet.txt'
9. using Heroku Scheduler add-on, newbot.py will run as a one-off 4 times across 24 hours, for a total of 4 neat posts a day.
